## Application guidelines
Applications can be submitted from March 24 to May 18 using [ConfTool](https://www.conftool.org/esudh2025/). When applying, a curriculum vitae and a letter of motivation (500-700 words) is to be uploaded as one PDF-file. In their motivation letter applicants should a) indicate their research interests, b) specify the workshop(s) of their choice c) justify their choice by explaining their hopes and expectations. If you decide to apply for the DARIAH scholarship, please explain why in a specific letter. Applicants also need to declare that an allocated place will be taken up.

As the selection of participants is made by the Scientific Committee together with the experts who lead the workshops, the CV and the letter of motivation are to be presented in English. As the Summer University is supposed to be multilingual the curriculum needs to contain information about the knowledge of languages.

Preference will be given to students and scholars of the Humanities and Social Sciences who are planning, or are already involved with, a technology-based research project  and describe this project in a qualified way in their motivation letter.

Students and scholars of Engineering and Computer Sciences are expected to describe their specialities and interests in such a way that also non specialists can follow, and to support their expectations from the summer university with good arguments.

Applicants who would like to present a project during one of the project presentation sessions or during the poster session should upload a seperate file with the description of the project (500-700 words) in English when they apply for a place at the Summer University via ConfTool. The presentation of a project is not a prerequisite for a successful application.
