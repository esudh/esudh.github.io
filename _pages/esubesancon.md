## ESU 2025 in Besançon, France

The ESU 2025 will be located within the premises of the [faculty of Humanities](http://slhs.univ-fcomte.fr/) of the [University Marie et Louis Pasteur](https://www.univ-fcomte.fr/){:target="_blank"} (formerly known as the Université de Franche-Comté, created in 1423) in the heart of Besançon. 
The ESU is organized in Besançon with the help of the teams of two masters in Digital Humanities ("mention Humanités Numériques”), the master [Rare Book and Digital Humanities](https://rare-book-and-digital-humanities.ubfc.fr/) and the master [Valorisation Numérique du Patrimoine Culturel Africain de l’Antiquité à nos Jours (VANUPAAJ)](https://formations.auf.org/home/formation/master-m2-humanites-numeriques-specialite-valorisation-numerique-du-patrimoine-africain-de-lantiquite-a-nos-jours-vanupaaj/) with the support of the [Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie](https://www.auf.org/)

### French for DH
As mentioned earlier, our main goal as organizers is that participants and instructors make the most of their stay in Besançon. In partnership with our [Centre de Linguistique Appliquée](https://cla.univ-fcomte.fr/home/) which has a tradition of more 70 years in teaching French for non-native speakers, we will propose a program of French classes along with the ESU. After the ESU, you will have to possibility to study French for 2 to 4 weeks during the month of August at our CLA and to benefit from university accommodation. 
The 2-week program will take place between Monday 4 August and Thursday 14 August for a cost of 486 Euros. The 4-week program will take place from Monday 4 August to Friday 29 August for a cost of 989,40 Euros.

## What to do, what to see

For us, organizers, welcoming the ESU also means welcoming scholars from all over the world to our territory. Throughout the two weeks of your stay in Besançon, we will try to give a snapshot of Besançon and its surroundings as well of our traditional food. 
We will come back to you in a few weeks with a more detailed program of meals and visits. Meanwhile, have a look at [Besançon](https://www.besancon-tourisme.com/en/destination/) and the surrounding [region](https://www.bourgognefranchecomte.com/)
